Lets practice resetting Adele's password to her Office 365 account 
- Select "Reset password" under her name
  - We can choose to automatically create a password for her, create a password on our own, force her to change the password upon logging on, and emailing ourselves her login information

Additionally, if we go back to Adele's profile, we can block her from signing-in 
- This is important if we believe that a user's account has been compromised
- To accomplish this action, we select the "Block sign-in" button, which is right next to "Reset password"

We can also delete Adele's profile by selecting the "Delete user" option on her profile
- Deleting her account will unassign her license and make it available to others
- We can also give other users access to her OneDrive files and emal

- We can now see the Engineering Department team under Active Teams and Groups
  - If we click on the team, we wil be able to see the owners and members of the team, general information, and be able to change settings of the Team
![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/office365admin/assets/153021794/63a3ad9b-3198-4b69-aa2b-582522f5afe1)

Each user on Office 365 will have their own inbox
  - However, users that are part of the same team can have access to a shared mailbox
  - External customers can send information to the email of the shared mailbox
  - Members of the group can also communicate to other members within the shared mailbox
  - Having a shared mailbox allows department spefic questions to go to a particular mailbox

Under Teams and Groups, select "Shared Mailboxes"
  - Click "Add a shared mailbox"
  - Create a name and an email for the shared mailbox
  - Select "Save changes" when done

Our newly created Engineering Department has a shared mailbox
  - Now it's time to add members

- We will now block this connection by going back to Microsoft Azure, and typing in "Network Security Groups" into the search bar
- On the left, we can click the "Inbound Security Rules" tab, and click the add button - this tab is selected because we want to block any ICMP traffic coming into VM2, hence the word "inbound"
- Be sure to select ICMP as the protocol and the deny option
  - ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol, and is the protocol that is used when using the ping command
- Lastly, select the add button, and the security rule will be created

![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/ca61784b-48d5-4c3d-86fc-db57538c90a9)
- Now, we can observe that any traffic being sent to VM2 is being blocked

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/25ae8002-6238-4782-bf84-f59863d0d4a3)
- We can reverse this process by going back to our NSG for VM2, selecting the rule we created, and clicking the allow button under ICMP
- Be sure to press "save" and the rule will be created

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/7d98f982-45f0-4928-8eb8-1af9450b4d3b)
- We can see the replies from VM2 coming back after we changed the inbound rule 

![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/dcaf8831-58c9-4eee-8774-a0f187424535)
- Utilizing SSH, we can also acces the Linux terminal of VM2 from VM1
  - To access VM2 using VM1, be sure to input SSH Username@IP Address
    - The username and IP address of the VM that you are trying to access
   
![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/dcec2035-05ec-472a-8a8f-12645b2a06fc)
- Once we filter for Remote Desktop Protocol traffic, we can see the inundation of traffic
  - This is because we are literally using RDP to access our VM
 
  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/20ff0139-ebf7-4af2-b4e8-7e5ab8ac5f94)
- After visiting different websites on our VM, we can see all the DNS information on Wireshark
- Additionally after utilizing the command "ipconfig /displaydns", we can see that our cache is full of information

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/4f6a5650-6f0a-46c3-ba8b-602a661b59c9)
- To flush our DNS cache, we can use the "ipconfig /flushdns" command
  - This command is really important when users are experiencing a multitude of DNS issues
 
![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/67e1cf2c-17f3-4859-8201-12f1d177169b)
- To view our DHCP and DNS servers, we can type the command "ipconfig /all" into command prompt

  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/e20a6d00-e5f7-4516-9a66-daf11afcfbaf)
- DHCP traffic can be analyzed by using the "ipconfig /release" and "ipconfig /renew" commands
  - The release command will tell our DHCP server to get rid of our current IP address, which was given to us via DHCP
  - The renew command will give us a new allocated IP address that is dynamically given via DHCP
  - Note that when you use these commands, your connection may be lost since we have "released" the VM's current IP address
 
  ![image](https://github.com/chriskhawaja/azure-network-protocols/assets/153021794/cad81990-28a6-4ddd-aea6-5eee091ed677)
  - You can now see in Wireshark, the steps of DHCP release and renewal
    - The DORA process highlights how a Client and DHCP Server communicate
      - Discovery, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge
